It takes you a while but now you have a campfire right in front of you.

~ firekit
You put the firekit on the ground and throw a lit match on it. 
It's warmth is gentle but takes no effort.

~ campfire_tree
It takes you a while but now you have a campfire right in front of you.
The warmth steeps into your body slowly.
Suddenly, a loud crack echoes above you.
do dj.play_crackling_wood()
do cabin.fade_to_black_then_back()
With a scikening weight, a blanket of snow tumbles from the branches. It crashes down, smothering the flames in a cloud of steam and ash.
do dj.play_thud()
do! get_node("/root/Main/Player").destroy_latest_campfire()
The weak hiss of the fire bites into your ears.
- View the cold remains.
	=> despair
- Try to shield the fire with your hands.
	=> futile_attempt
- Look around
	=> go

~ despair
The warmth evaporates quickly. Your fingers grow numb with the weight of the falling snow. The cold wraps tighter.

- Try to relight the fire.
	=> relight_fire

- Take a second to think of what you can do.
	=> hopeless

- Give up on this campfire.
	
	=> go

~ go
This campfire won't be of any use. You need to make a new one. 
You must do it again.
Away from the trees this time.
You must do it soon.
do! get_node("/root/Main/Player/Warmth").decrease_warmth(20)
do loot.unfreeze() 
do Globald.in_dialogue = false
=> END

~ hopeless
There is nothing you can do. 
The cold is sweet, it wraps you up completely.
The campfire laughs at you.
What a stupid thing to do.
He was right.
You gather whatever is left of yourself

=> END

~ futile_attempt
Your hands tremble, moving to shield the dying embers. But it is no use â€” the snow is heavier than hope, and the fire dies beneath your frozen grasp.

- Try to relight the fire.
	=> relight_fire


~ relight_fire
Your numb fingers fumble for the matches, you drop a couple of them.

You're sure he will love this story when you tell him.
He will tell you "I told you so!"
It's funny.
